                    LT Controls engineered a very unique worldâ€™s first new
                    automatic grading and sorting system for a leading global
                    food company JBS beef Foods with operations in the United
                    States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Mexico, New Zealand and
                    the UK. This included automating the process of graded sides
                    from the Kill Floor to the Boning Room on new conveyors,
                    while tracking and storing carcass information. The number
                    of sides and Chiller Assessment (CA) grade were settable for
                    each of the four boning chains. A control system interfaced
                    with a Microsoft MySQL database was used. The positions of
                    carcasses were tracked using relative and absolute encoders,
                    and numerous sensors and RFID tags were used for tracking
                    and storing data. The areas included the Hot Beef Passage,
                    Cold Beef Passage, Hot and Cold Beef Passage, Marshalling
                    Incline, Marshalling Distribution, Marshalling Room 1-3,
                    Marshalling Outfeed and Boning Room Infeed. Deliverables
                    included PLC code, SCADA, alarming, paperless reporting and
                    OEE.

                    LT Controls was approached to perform an upgrade of the JBS
                    Kill Floor PLC program from SLC to an Allen Bradley Control
                    Logix. This program included converting 15 IO racks
                    consisting of DHRIO and Device Net as well as the Kill Floor
                    Synchronisation and merged them into one project. This
                    includes remapping all the IO and removing all aliases from
                    the program. As well as this, the Experion SCADA System
                    needed to have updated tag addresses for the new PLC.
                    LT Controls also remapped all the devices and removed 2
                    Device Net racks and converted these to Ethernet Point IO.
                    Finally, as well as supervising the electrical and IO
                    Testing, LT Controls implemented a fibre ring for network
                    redundancy in the case of any nodes dropping out.

                    When JBS was looking to upgrade the APV PLC from Allen

                    contacted for the job. This involved merging the existing
                    PLC code into the new Kill Floor PLC and commissioning all
                    the IO as it was wired into the new PLC. As well as this, a
                    Schneider Proface Panel needed to be updated with the new
                    tag names.

                    HOT MEAT CHILLER UPGRADE
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[var(--text)] flex-grow mb-4">
                    LT Controls was engaged to perform a complete reprogram and
                    PLC upgrade for the Hot Meat Chillers at Australian Country
                    Choice (ACC). This project consisted of 10 chillers, with
                    each chiller being able to choose from 10 different profiles
                    to ensure optimal cooling of the product. To complete this
                    project all the existing Omron PLCâ€™s needed to be removed
                    and replaced with Allen Bradley PLCâ€™s. Furthermore, both
                    HMIâ€™s and SCADA interfaces needed to be designed and
                    implemented to ensure precise control of the system. These
                    control systems needed security measures to ensure only
                    those authorised could control the operation. In conjunction
                    with this, LT Controls reprogrammed the Ammonia detection
                    and implemented SMS alarms to alert supervisors when these
                    alarms were triggered. The commissioning of this project was
                    split into two stages with Chillerâ€™s 1 to 4 being completed
                    over one weekend, and the remaining Chillerâ€™s 5 to 10 being
                    commissioned in a following weekend without complications.

                    Floor Chain by 1m with Wileyâ€™s and CEQ to allow for bigger
                    beef to be processed. This included adding a new head
                    removal hoist and reprogramming it to fit with the new
                    height of the chain. As well as this, 4 new stimulation
                    points were added in and the hide puller needed to be
                    reprogrammed with a new stimulation arm. As well as this,
                    the hock restrainer was commissioned by LT Controls and the
                    Elevator was also reprogrammed and commissioned. The
                    existing Panelview HMI was removed and replaced with a
                    Beijer HMI. LT Controls was also responsible for the master

                    LT Controls was recently tasked with reprogramming the whole
                    Dog Roll Line at Real Pet Food which had previously suffered
                    from several issues. LT Controls was informed that numerous
                    programmers had been consulted for the project, but none had
                    been able to solve the problem. This system used 3 fillers
                    and 3 coolers, and the synchronisation of conveyor speeds
                    had caused many issues with product falling to the floor. To
                    rectify this LT spent time to investigate how the product
                    ran and developed a system for each product time to ensure
                    optimal conveyor speeds. As well as this a switching routine
                    was developed to use 1 filler to feed 2 coolers at double
                    the rate in the case of a filler fail.

                    The Chunkers Line was originally running with Omron PLC and

                    was installed to increase the production compacity.
                    LT Controls programmed the operation of the new cooker and
                    at the same time reprogrammed the whole Chunkers Line with
                    Allen Bradley PLC and VSD from the mixing area, cooking
                    area, conveyor system and packing area. And converted the

                    At Norco Milk Labrador, LT Controls was responsible for the
                    Filler 2 Milk Reclaim Upgrade. This consisted of
                    implementing a new system to recover lost milk as well as a
                    new CIP program. As well as this, a new CIP Kitchen was to
                    be added which involved reprogramming the CIP routine with
                    new Tanks and lines. This CIP program was to be integrated
                    into the current Tanker Bay CIP program to ensure efficient
                    cleaning and no waste of CIP. In conjunction with the CIP
                    program, LT also provided new Citect Pages to control this
                    system and upgraded the existing Citect System from version
                    7.2 to 8.1.

                    PRODUCTION AUTOMATION
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[var(--text)] flex-grow mb-4">
                    LT was approached to provide automation for the entire
                    production line at Grove Juice Warwick, up until the
                    bottling process. This was split into several programs,
                    including Juice Extraction, Pasteurization, Extraction to
                    Tanks, Batching between Tanks, and finally CIP routines. The
                    largest of these programs being the Pasteurization which
                    consisted of 72 different paths for sending juice and
                    required the control of over 100 valves. To ensure no
                    contamination of tanks these programs required a series of
                    interlocks to ensure that no program operated a valve that
                    was being used elsewhere. Furthermore, in the event of a
                    physical valve failure, a shutdown sequence was programmed
                    to ensure no contamination. As well as the PLC programming,
                    LT was required to create SCADA pages with Ignition to allow
                    the operators full control over the system, and setup
                    trending to monitor the process and make improvements.
